-- | Module to work with Golomb-coded sets (GCS).
--
-- For each block, compact filters are derived containing sets of items associated with the block (eg. addresses sent to, outpoints spent, etc.). A set of such data objects is compressed into a probabilistic structure called a Golomb-coded set (GCS), which matches all items in the set with probability 1, and matches other items with probability 1/M for some integer parameter M. The encoding is also parameterized by P, the bit length of the remainder code. Each filter defined specifies values for P and M.
--
-- At a high level, a GCS is constructed from a set of N items by:
--
-- * hashing all items to 64-bit integers in the range [0, N * M)
--
-- * sorting the hashed values in ascending order
--
-- * computing the differences between each value and the previous one
--
-- * writing the differences sequentially, compressed with Golomb-Rice coding

-- | To check membership of an item in a compressed GCS, one must reconstruct
-- the hashed set members from the encoded deltas. The procedure to do so is
-- the reverse of the compression: deltas are decoded one by one and added to a
-- cumulative sum. Each intermediate sum represents a hashed value in the original
-- set. The queried item is hashed in the same way as the set members and compared
-- against the reconstructed values. Note that querying does not require the
-- entire decompressed set be held in memory at once.
