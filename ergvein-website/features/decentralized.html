<p>Indexers are a crucial part of the project.</p>
<p>Their first task is to track several cryptocurrencies and prepare filters for each of them. More on filters in the SPV section.</p>
<p>Indexers form a decentralized network for our blockchain. It hosts and manages orders for atomic swaps. </p>
<p>We host a number of indexers as a backbone of the network. Their URLs are hard-coded into the app and they serve as a bootstrap.</p>
<p>Indexers are open-sourced as well, so you can set up your own indexer, join the network, and start mining tokens!</p>
<p>Tokens are used to pay fees for placing exchange orders in the blockchain, so you will most likely need them.</p>
<p>However, decentralization does not stop there! The app allows you to create an exchange order and send it manually to a friend, who will paste it into his or her app and perform the swap. No fees, no information stored in the blockchain. A perfect solution for an extra cautious user. </p>
